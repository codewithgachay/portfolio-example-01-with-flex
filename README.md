# Responsive Layout with Flexbox and Media Query

This is the first website page I have created using flexbox with media queries to create a layout that responds to different sized screens.

Media queries are commonly used in responsive designs in order to display a different layout to different devices, depending on their screen size. The reason for this is that certain layouts will always look too squashed (or even completely broken) when viewed on narrower screens.

Therefore I used media queries to display layout 1 to wide screens (desktops, laptops, etc), layout 2 to medium sized screens (tablets, large phones), and layout 3 to narrow screens (mobile phones, etc) so that it displays differently on smaller devices/viewports.
